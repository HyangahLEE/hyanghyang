<p>A series of rather unusual events have been attributed to the hot weather. In Gangneung, Gangwon Province, a chick was hatched Tuesday from a carton of eggs that had been placed in an outdoor balcony for a few days, a resident in the region claimed. 

According to Choi Ho-jun, 59, the Gangneung resident who now owns the chick, the egg from one of the chickens he raises in his backyard had never been brooded by the mother hen or placed under brooding lamps. The unusually warm weather basically did all the work, he said. </p>

<p>South Korea's prolonged heat wave is producing a number of unusual moments, including a chick hatching out of an egg reportedly without a mother hen or brooder lamp -- thanks to the blazing heat and continued tropical nights. 

The country has been enduring unusually scorching weather for weeks since early July. Daytime highs exceeded 38 degrees Celsius in Seoul and other regions on Tuesday, while the temperature in Yeongcheon, North Gyeongsang Province, reached 40.3 degrees on the same day. 

As of Wednesday morning, 14 people had died due to heat-related illness, while heat stress has killed at least 1.43 million livestock. More than 1,300 Koreans have been medically treated for health conditions caused by the hot weather, including heat stroke. </p>
